Teaching 
======
- In January 2026, "3D Printing of Invariant Manifolds in Dynamical Systems" will be published in the AMS Notices. 
- In July 2025 I taught an SL Math Summer Course [Computer Assisted Proofs in Applied Mathematics](https://www.slmath.org/summer-schools/1107)
with Jonathan Jaquette. 
- Fall 2025, I am teaching Mathematics Through 3D Printing, a course I have developed.
- [Teaching](https://esander1789.github.io/teaching/)
- [Students](https://esander1789.github.io/students/) 
- I have advised vertically integrated graduate-undergraduate research projects at [MEGL](https://megl.science.gmu.edu), most recently ["Predicting Flood Zones Using Topological Data Analysis"](https://megl.science.gmu.edu/spring-2025/). 

Research
======
My current research is primarily in the fields of dynamical systems and mathematical visualization and design. Recent research includes

- Study of quasiperiodicity and chaos
- Computational methods for studying dynamics
- Rigorous computation of bifurcations
- Phase field models in materials science
- 3D printing of mathematical objects

Patrick R. Bishop, Summer Chenoweth, Emmanuel Fleurantin, Alonso Ogueda-Oliva,
 Julia Seay, and I have an upcoming paper on 3D Printing Invariant Manifolds
in the AMS Notices, to appear early 2026. 

For more details, see my [Publications](https://esander1789.github.io/publications/)
and [Talks](https://esander1789.github.io/talks/).
