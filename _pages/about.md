Teaching 
======

- In July 2025 I will be teaching an SL Math Summer Course [Computer Assisted Proofs in Applied Mathematics](https://www.slmath.org/summer-schools/1107)
with Jonathan Jaquette. 
- [Teaching](https://esander1789.github.io/teaching/)
- [Students](https://esander1789.github.io/students/) 
- I have advised vertically integrated graduate-undergraduate research projects at [MEGL](https://megl.science.gmu.edu), most recently ["Predicting Flood Zones Using Topological Data Analysis"](https://megl.science.gmu.edu/spring-2025/). 

Research
======
My current research is primarily in the fields of dynamical systems and mathematical visualization and design. Recent research includes

- Study of quasiperiodicity and chaos
- Computational methods for studying dynamics
- Rigorous computation of bifurcations
- Phase field models in materials science
- 3D printing of mathematical objects

For more details, see my [Publications](https://esander1789.github.io/publications/)
and [Talks](https://esander1789.github.io/talks/).
